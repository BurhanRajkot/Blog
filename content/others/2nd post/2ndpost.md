# Hello ppl.

So I *was* going to write about the hacka thon — the Mumbai Hacks shitshow and the other one that was actually kinda nice — **but today I have something better to share.**

My PC was recently diagnosed with **"fuck-all-too-much-use-of-GPU-and-CPU" syndrome** because I pushed it way too far while working on Unity projects, Unreal experiments, and (spoiler) *playing games*.

## The Great PC Meltdown™

Apparently this excessive load somehow **fried my motherboard**.
Yes. That “Ohm’s Law shit” that we study in textbooks?
I witnessed it live in my PC. Incredible experience. Would not recommend.

So yeah — motherboard went brrr → motherboard went *dead* → motherboard went for *repair*.

They changed the thermal paste, did some electronic CPR, and got it back alive.
But then the GPU decided to act mysterious — “I will work only sometimes.”
Luckily, updating drivers slapped it back to reality.

Now everything is **finally working again**.

And no, I didn’t fix any of this myself.
I sent it to someone because I’m *not that fucking technical*.

## Now that the PC works again...

The plan is simple:

- The half-baked Unity game I submitted during the Unity Game Jam?
  Yeah… that was a mess.
  I’ll try to fix it *somehow*.

- I’m also working on a **new project** (announcement soon).
  I know nobody is reading this, but IF you are… contact me pls.
  I need emotional support or at least a "hi".

## Things to look forward to

- A **new project** coming soon
- **Unity 2D course** continuation
- **Python** learning
- **Data Science**
- **Math**
- **Consumer Electronics**

I’m really enjoying tinkering with AutoCAD, ESP32, and other electronics.
Plus I have a BEE KT (lol), so all this tinkering technically counts as studying.

Anyway, that’s life right now.

**Adios.**
