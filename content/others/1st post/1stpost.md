# Alright alright alright

Welcome to the **Others** section.
Here I write about whatever I'm thinking in the moment — basically journaling — but this fucking shit gets posted on the internet for anyone to read, which is fucking weird in the first place.

Fucking shit man.

Had a terrible day anyway. I'm not going into fucking specifics — I know people want to know any and everything about my life but no, people cannot do that XD.

Alright, so right now I have **3–5 goals** that need to be done by the end of next month:

1. **Finish my Maths 1** completely
2. Get done with the **Unity Engine 2D course**
3. Get started with **competitive programming (CP)**

Maths 1 and Unity are what I REALLY want to get done before this year ends.

Along with that, my Unity game — the one I submitted half complete on itch.io — I want to finish that too.

But my PC is not working. Either the **motherboard is dead**, or the **CPU**. GPU seems fine so far, but if the motherboard is dead then the CPU might also be gone, since Ryzen CPUs usually die when the motherboard fries itself.

So yeah. We have to wait and see.

When I get my PC back, the work on the game will begin again.
Until then, that’s on hold.

Maths 1 has 3 chapters left — I think I’ll finish those.
Unity game too — but it has to wait until the PC is fixed.

So this is the plan.
I’ll write again in **15 days** with progress.

Adios.
